## Description

This app is designed to assist people signing up for their covid-19 vaccine. There is a sign up page for the user to input their information, including email adress, name, state of residence, age, and if they are an essential worker. This information is then stored in a database. After the user is signed up, they are taken to a page that displays their state's statistics concerning covid-19. If the user is eligible for the vaccine, there will be an embedded map with the closest vaccine clinic.
